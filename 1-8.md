# Process - Part 8 - Start the Java Apps

## 8.1 Start your consumer using the command provided. What directory must you be in to run this command as provided? Why?

Ans: 
- You can start Kafka consumer using the below command from C:\44517\kafka_2.12-2.4.1:
#### .\bin\windows\kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic bearcat-messages --from-beginning
- If there is any existing project: Open PowerShell here as Administrator in the root project folder, start the original consumer app using topic test and group1 using the below command:
#### java -cp target/kafka-api-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.spnotes.kafka.simple.Consumer test group1
- For Starting Custom producer Open PowerShell as Administrator in the root project folder, start the original consumer app: 
#### java -cp target/kafka-case-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar edu.nwmissouri.isl.bhagyasree2895.kafka.CustomConsumer
We need to run these commands from the above specified directories because When a consumer group is active, you can inspect partition assignments, groups and consumption progress from the command line using the consumer-groups.sh script, which is located in the bin directory of the Kafka distribution.
